# STATE — live task state (resume point for any fresh session)

> Updated continuously during work; at minimum at the end of every phase/task.
> A fresh session should be able to resume from THIS FILE ALONE.
> Discipline defined in `.claude/rules/memory.md` (Phase 5).

## Current effort: Foundation Audit & Upgrade (10-phase overhaul)
- **Plan**: `/Users/tamargrosz/.claude/plans/greedy-inventing-allen.md` (approved 2026-07-05)
- **Tracking**: AUDIT_REPORT.md (findings + effort log), NEEDS_DECISION.md (human decisions), TEMPLATE_BOUNDARY.md (company content log)
- **Branch**: local `main`, one commit per phase `foundation: phase N — <summary>`, NO push without founder ask
- **Context**: agents RESUMED 2026-07-05 by remote session (3 disjoint lanes, 6h cadence, `.agents_paused` deleted) — infra edits on shared files now need the concurrency check (activity_log) first
- **2026-07-06 (main session)**: protection-layer hardening shipped — jeff GATE 0 (deterministic lane ownership), circuit breaker (3 consecutive failed cycles → auto-pause + TG), conflict TTL (chronic branch → one-time TG escalation; `auto/ayalon`+`auto/scout` will escalate on jeff's next run — founder should reconcile-or-delete them), main-canary (smoke on direct human pushes to main), `.gitattributes` union-merge for append-only logs, loop-liveness re-pointed to autopilot-managers (was watching the DISABLED autopilot.yml; window 3h→7h)

## Mark lane — last run (2026-07-19, run 3)
- **Task**: UX dead-button fix — Explore editorial grid cards were unclickable (cursor:pointer but no handler)
- **Done**: Added `data-q` attr to each card in `renderExGrid()` template + delegated click listener in `initExplore()`. Tapping any editorial card now populates ex-input and runs `runExSearch()`. Commit d3923fe. check-render + node --check clean.
- **Remaining**: INBOX UX bug-hunt: text overlap/truncation (fc-caption no line-clamp, fc-hdr-user overflows, fc-tags unlimited pills, up-vibe no max-height) + more dead buttons (Explore grid done; rewards locked perk buttons still silent).
- **Prior runs**: DS-004 fix (1e41dde), UX-QA P1 bottom-sheets (f084233), OW-001 wl-wrap fix confirmed on main.

## Steve lane — last run (2026-07-19)
- **Task**: DATABASE_URL → Postgres migration (INBOX launch infra step 3)
- **Done**: `_CompatDB` + `_PgCursorProxy` classes in app.py; `_get_db()` returns `_CompatDB` (dialect='sqlite' or 'postgres'); `?`→`%s` translation; `RealDictCursor` for dict-like rows; `SELECT lastval()` for lastrowid; `init_db()` skips when DATABASE_URL set; `psycopg2-binary>=2.9` in requirements.txt; `notes/schema_postgres.sql` for Supabase manual setup; 3 new pytests (80 total)
- **Remaining**: Launch infra step 4 (Supabase Storage for images); SPA side Supabase Auth (mark lane)
- **CI_FAILURES note**: combined patch (BASE-anchor + GATE 3 stale-ownership fix) still NOT applied on main. Escalation stands in NEEDS_YOU.md. Do NOT re-analyze.
- **Founder action needed**: Set DATABASE_URL on Render dashboard (postgresql://...) to activate Postgres; run notes/schema_postgres.sql in Supabase SQL editor once.

## 🔴 ACTIVE (2026-07-19, Maayan + main session) — supersedes the paused Foundation-Audit state above
Two parallel tracks; lanes are RUNNING (not paused), cadence every 2h, model claude-sonnet-4-6.

**Track 1 — LAUNCH INFRA (target: full launch ~2026-08-18, first cohort ~200 users):**
- Backend LIVE on Render: `https://awear-x4o2.onrender.com` (Capacitor `server.url` points here; app runs on a real iPhone + uploaded to TestFlight as `com.awear.fashion` under Segev Olpak's paid Apple acct; Carmel invited, pending his email accept).
- Supabase project created; SUPABASE_* + DATABASE_URL set in Render. Agent epic (INBOX ★★★): Auth → Postgres (steve wired `_get_db()` choke-point) → Storage. DECISIONS #17.
- Image-gen (`/api/generate-garment`, OpenAI, demo-first) built — LIVE call fails (needs OpenAI org-verify + billing); decided match-first + cache for scale; free alt = bg-removal (route B), deferred.

**Track 2 — HARDEN THE AUTONOMY ENGINE (founder: perfect by 2026-07-20 eve, then re-test):**
Full-pipeline audit done. Fixes shipped by MAIN SESSION (lanes can't touch `.github/`): P0 base-anchor OW-013 (fc6b321 — THE 'nothing lands' bug), ownership-map alignment (05cfba4), P1 rejection-feedback + P2 INBOX/shared + P4 self-heal routing (92b353c). Cadence 6h→2h. Lanes redirected to infra-hardening ONLY (no features) until the re-test.
- REMAINING: verify the next cycle lands work (gate-ledger); phantom-lane cleanup; GATE 3 determinism; evaluate GitHub-native CODEOWNERS + Merge Queue (strategic simplification).

## Open questions
See NEEDS_DECISION.md — defaults applied, none blocking. Live founder decisions: OpenAI billing (for live image-gen) · which Apple acct for the real launch (Segev's vs own).

## Test commands (preserve across compaction)
- Server: `venv312/bin/uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000`
- Render check: `npm run check-render`
- Guards: `bash scripts/guard_checks.sh`
- Tests/lint: pytest + ruff arrive in Phase 7
